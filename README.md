## Overview

### The Challenge

The goal of this challenge is to build out a responsive blog preview card component using semantic HTML and modern CSS (custom properties, Flexbox, mobile‐first layout). Users should be able to:

- View the card on mobile (375px) with the illustration on top and content stacked below.
- View the same card on desktop, centered on a yellow background (no separate two‐column layout).
- See a hover state: when hovering anywhere on the card, the title turns gold and the card lifts slightly.
- Use semantic markup and follow the provided style guide for colors, typography, and spacing.

## My Process

### Built With

- **HTML5** for semantic markup
- **CSS3** (Custom Properties, Flexbox)
- **Mobile‐First Workflow** (design and layout start at 375px width)
- **Google Fonts – Figtree** (Weights: 500, 800)
- **[Frontend Mentor Style Guide](./style-guide.md)** for color and typography reference

### What I Learned

- **Mobile‐First Design**

  - The card had to remain a single column at all breakpoints. Instead of switching to a two‐column layout on desktop, the container stays fixed at 375px wide, and extra yellow “canvas” shows on either side.

- **Hover States & Transitions**

  - Applying a subtle `transform: translateY(-5px)` on `.card:hover` creates a lifted effect.
  - Transitioning the heading color on hover (`.card:hover .card__title`) makes the title text turn gold.

- **Using CSS Custom Properties**

  - Defined root variables for color palette, font sizes, border radius, and shadow.
  - This makes it easy to tweak colors (e.g., the “Learning” pill background and hover title color) in one place.

- **Semantic HTML Structure**

  - Used `<article>` for the card, `<div class="card__image">` for the illustration wrapper, and `<div class="card__content">` for textual content.
  - The author section is grouped inside a `<div class="card__author">` with an `<img>` for the avatar and a `<span>` for the name.

- **CSS Flexbox for Vertical Alignment**

  - Inside `.card__content`, `display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 1rem;` allows the author row to auto‐align at the bottom with `margin-top: auto;`.

### Continued Development

- **Accessibility Improvements**

  - Add `alt` text improvements (e.g., more descriptive text for the illustration).
  - Make the card focusable via keyboard and ensure the hover/focus state applies to keyboard users as well.

- **Refinement of Responsive Images**

  - Consider using `srcset` for the illustration to serve an SVG fallback or different image formats (e.g., WebP) based on browser support.

- **Component Reusability**

  - Refactor the card into a reusable component (e.g., React/Vue) to accept dynamic props (category, date, title, description, author) and easily generate multiple cards.
